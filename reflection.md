## What Copilot generated
I used Copilot to generated the code to remove the negative value and make the data into lower case. Also I promt it with pandas and numpy to make it more suitable with this assignment. I notice that the code that came from Copilot is not easy to understand when compare to my own code. However, AI will be a part of our future, so it is not a bad time to start learning it.

## What you modified
I let Copilot know the variables name that I need and want. I also let them know that I have just learned Python so make it easy to understand. At first it try to teach me logging, I was thinking of removing it and but I think that I want to learn more to I start to learn about logging.

## What you learned
I reckon that I learn how to promt with AI, how to vib coding like a computer science major. Though this assignment, I learn more about logging, which is fun and useful. I also know more about how to adopt AI into my work.
